# Agent Training for Honor of Kings 1v1 (Luban 7th)

This project focuses on training an AI agent to play Honor of Kings (王者荣耀) 1v1 matches using the PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) algorithm. The agent is specifically trained to play as Luban 7th (鲁班七号), aiming to gain advantages and achieve victory in 1v1 scenarios.

## Project Overview

The goal is to develop an intelligent agent that can:
- Master Luban 7th's mechanics and abilities
- Make strategic decisions in 1v1 matchups
- Optimize resource management (gold, experience)
- Maintain positional advantages
- Secure objectives and win conditions

## Competition Results

In the final ladder tournament evaluation, our model demonstrated excellent performance and achieved outstanding results:

- 🥈 Second Place in the overall rankings
- Strong performance in 1v1 matchups
- Consistent decision-making and strategic execution
- Effective resource management and objective control
